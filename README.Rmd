# Summary

We follow the money through the change of time, party affiliation, and states. In the first visualization, the total transaction between Republicans and Democrats is compared between two states: UT and MA. The second visualization traces the amount of transactions as the time changes between Republicans and Democrats, which indicates the timing when the transaction reaches its peak. The main focus of these visualizations is the money, more specifically where the money is going and when it is being given at the highest rates. The graphs show the transaction totals in relation to these specifications, following the money in them.


## Comparison of Total transaction between Republicans and Democrats in MA and TX 

In this visualization, we are shown the difference in total transactions between Massachusetts and Texas, differentiated by the two main political parties, in a faceted bar graph. These states were chosen because Massachusetts is typically regarded as more of a Democrat state and Texas more Republican, and the graphs reflect that in how both made more transactions in favor of those respective political parties. Massachusetts in particular made a lot more transactions in favor of the Democrat party, and Texas, though not contributing as much money to either party overall, also made noticeably more transactions in favor of the Republican party.

The purpose of this visualization is to show how these two states have made very different decisions when it comes to who exactly they are sending their money to. The overall total transactions made by Massachusetts seems to be higher than the overall total transactions made by Texas, suggesting that Massachusetts had a heavier investment in the 2016 election than Texas did.

Overall, the visualization shows a distinct difference in where transactions go depending on state and political party for Massachusetts and Texas, as well as a difference in how much they sent to the countryâ€™s two main political parties. Their statuses as Democrat and Republican states respectively do seem to ring true given how their donations were for the most part sent towards those parties, though it was surprising to see Massachusetts with more overall transactions than Texas given their smaller population and ability to swing an election.

## Comparison of Demorats and Republicans on the change of the amount of transaction based on time period

The line graph shows the difference in the total transaction as the time proceeds to the election date between Democrats and Republicans from January 21st, 2016 to December 14th, 2016. On November 8th, 2016, the election day, the amount of transactions of both parties reached its peak, and the Republicans had a higher maximum value of transactions than Democrats. This difference contributed to the result of the election that Republicans won the election. We may also notice that there are sudden increases in timing except for the election day for both parties. This change indicates that whatever the event was happening around May for Democrats and July for Republicans, it would be closely related to money.

Overall, the trend of the amount of transaction in both Democrats and Republicans follows our expectation: as the time gets closer to the election date, the more the transaction is made, and the amount of money transacted dropped dramatically as the election date was passed. More specifically, same as our deduction, since Republicans won the election in 2016, the amount of transactions of Republicans on the election date is higher than that of Democrats. Also, the election date is not the only event that causes a greater amount of transactions, other events happening may also count as an important factor to the money flow. In conclusion, the visualization allows us to deduct whether the events happening on a specific date have an influence on the amount of money transacted, and therefore, deduct which events have a close relation to money.

```{r line_graph, echo=FALSE}
fectime <- contributions %>%
  inner_join(candidates, by = "cand_id") %>%
  mutate(transaction_abs = abs(transaction_amt)) %>%
  select(cand_pty_affiliation, transaction_abs, transaction_dt)  %>%
  filter(cand_pty_affiliation == "DEM" | cand_pty_affiliation == "REP", 
         transaction_dt >= as.Date("2016-1-21"),
         transaction_dt <= as.Date("2016-12-14"))

ggplot(fectime, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = transaction_abs, color = cand_pty_affiliation))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ cand_pty_affiliation)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("DEM" = "blue",
                                "REP" = "red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
